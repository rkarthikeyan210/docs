**#Spring**
  * Spring makes it easy to create Java enterprise applications. It provides everything you need to build.
  * Refer to the Spring Framework project itself, which is where it all started. Over time, other Spring projects have been built on top of the Spring Framework. Most often, when people say "Spring", they mean the entire family of projects.

**#SpringIOC (DI)**
 - Dependency injection (DI) is a specialized form of IoC, whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments.

**#Bean**
 - A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container

**#Configuration Metadata**
 - This meta data is used as instructions to the Spring Container to instantiate objects and assemble them. These meta data is represented as "Java annotations" by developer in code.
