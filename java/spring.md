#SpringIOC (DI)
Dependency injection (DI) is a specialized form of IoC, whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments.

#Bean
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container

#Configuration Metadata
This meta data is used as instructions to the Spring Container to instantiate objects and assemble them. These meta data is represented as "Java annotations" by developer in code.
